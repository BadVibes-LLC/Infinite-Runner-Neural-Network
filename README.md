# Infinite-Runner-Neural-Network
 
This project is an implementation of the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. This is a regression algorithm that is intended to preform unsupervised learning over time. 

I started this project to learn more about how deep learning algorithms work. Lots of Python libraries cut out the complicated formulas and other details. It was the details that I wanted to understand. There are several different types of machine learning algorithms, but this one didn't rely on 'Darwinism', as in creating several instances of an AI and using natural selection to take the best of each generation. It also solved a lot of the issues with overfitting and dead neurons. There are still some issues with the project, but it served it's purpose of being a test enviroment for exploring the innerworkings of machine learning (ML).
